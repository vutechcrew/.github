# Villanova University Tech Crew 
## Serving The Villanova Community

Villanova University Tech Crew specializes in providing audio, lighting, and event production services to on-campus organizations. We guarantee constant professionalism and are consistently able to beat the prices of outside vendors. VUTC has an outstanding level of experience working over 120 events per year including several alongside outside audio companies.

## Software Development Activities
VUTC manages all event logistics through a custom web application hosted at VUTC.com. The site is student developed and managed. VUTC is currently redesigning the website to align it with best practices and to leverage modern frameworks and tooling. The new site is a laravel-based PHP webapp with a bootstrapped front end and a MySQL database.

As a result of this redesign, VUTC has contributed to several open source projects, as well as developed a series of githooks to automate portions of our development process. These contributions are outlined below:
-    [aaronlord/laroute](https://github.com/vutechcrew/laroute) - laroute is a package that extends laravel's routing functionality to javascript. See [our pull request against the upstream](https://github.com/aaronlord/laroute/pull/105) for our contributions.
-    [beyondcode/laravel-credentials](https://github.com/vutechcrew/laravel-credentials) - The beyondcode/laravel-credentials package allows you to store all your secret credentials in an encrypted file and put that file into version control instead of having to add multiple credentials into your .env file in your production environment. See [our pull request against the upstream](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-credentials/pull/39) for our contributions, which include fixes to enable compatibility with a Windows development environment.
-    [jeremykenedy/laravel-roles](https://github.com/vutechcrew/laravel-roles) - A Powerful package for handling roles and permissions in Laravel. Supports Laravel 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0+.  See [our pull request against the upstream](https://github.com/jeremykenedy/laravel-roles/pull/144) for our contributions, which implement additional flexibility in the handling of role levels.
-    [vutechcrew/githooks](https://github.com/vutechcrew/githooks) - it Hooks intended to simplify development efforts on vutc-laravel. These are also suitable for use in any PHP project that uses Composer as a dependency manager and dotenv files for environment variable handling. See the [README for the repository](https://github.com/vutechcrew/githooks#readme) for more information.
